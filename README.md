In order to make the combat system more dynamic, I aim to introduce variables that can influence the outcome of fights, taking into account strategy, reaction time, and player experience. This implementation focuses on allowing players to choose the direction of their attacks, rather than relying on repetitive default combos that remain the same regardless of the situation.

The proposed system operates by enabling players to hold down the mouse button and, while doing so, move the cursor either left or right. Upon releasing the button, the character will perform animations based on the chosen direction. Additionally, opponents will have the ability to dodge in their preferred direction.

This approach offers an engaging and responsive combat experience, providing players with the flexibility to adapt to various in-game scenarios. The key elements of this system include handling user input, determining attack direction, triggering animations, implementing dodging mechanics, enforcing cooldowns for both attacks and dodges, and enhancing feedback through visual effects and animations. The ultimate goal is to create a well-balanced and rewarding combat system that encourages strategic play.

I use Raycasy Hitbox 4.01 for hit box detection
